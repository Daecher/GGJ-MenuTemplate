# GGJ-MenuTemplate

## What is this?
This repo is a simple template (with a few odds and ends) for a basic menu transition, audio settings, and pause menu.

## What is this for?
The purpose of this project is to have a (mostly) barebones framework for building a game jam entry around in order to mitigate the hassle of doing it from scratch.

Note: This template was made exclusively between the hours of 12 to 3 A.M., and may have a lingering bug or missing feature you don't have. Feel free to notify me if there are any additions you'd like to recommend.
