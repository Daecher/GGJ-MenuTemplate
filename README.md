# GGJ-MenuTemplate

## What is this?
This repo is a simple template (with a few odds and ends) for a basic menu transition, audio settings, and pause menu.

## What is this for?
The purpose of this project is to have a (mostly) barebones framework for building a game jam entry around in order to mitigate the hassle of doing it from scratch.

## What if I've already started a project?
Head over to the Releases tab to get the latest version of the template (produced in Unity 2019.1.14f1).

## Can I work with this in another version of Unity?
For any version of Unity later than 2019.1.14f1, yes, you should be able to update the project or import the most recently released .unitypackage file. If you're in an earlier version of Unity later than 2018.3, you can create an issue and I'll see what I can do to get a port made and added to the Releases. However, if you're working in a version of Unity prior to 2018.3, you will not be able to use this asset without updating to 2018.3 due to the prefab overhaul that occurred in that update.

Note: This template was made exclusively between the hours of 12 to 3 A.M., and may have a lingering bug or is missing a feature you'd really like. Feel free to notify me if there are any additions you want to recommend.
